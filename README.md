# Spring-Boot-JDBCTemplate-Flyway-Gradle-PostgreSQL
## This application is a small victorious microservice for data processing. A certain restaurant chain collects information about what dishes customers liked the most.
To do this, I made this microservice :)
+ This application is created on Spring Boot 2.5.1.
+ Gradle is used as the collector.
+ PostgreSQL is used as the database.
+ The table is created using Flyway.
